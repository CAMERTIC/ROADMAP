However, the Road Plan does not feature in the Convention within the pages allocated to Annexes, where there are only 9 Annexes as provided in the general table of contents of the Convention. \n\nIn fact, the original wording of article 14.1 of the Convention shows that it was initially planned to include the Road Plan as an Annex to the Convention. We understand that this option has been abandonned as article 14.1 of the Convention does not provide anymore the inclusion of the Road Plan among the Annexes to the Convention. 9 Annexes should therefore be considered rather than 10.\n\nAmong theses Annexes, Annex I (Accession Notice), Annex II (BF Construction Conditions), Annex IV (Collective Bargaining Agreement), Annex VII (Fiscal & Custom Regime), Annex VIII (Mine Gate Value Determination) and Annex IX (Certain Shareholders Provisions) were attached to the Convention at the Signature Date.\n\nThis Conditions Precedent is, therefore, relating to 3 of the Annexes to the Convention:\n\n- Annex III: Tariff Frameworks;\n- Annex V: Tax Depreciation Schedule; and\n- Annex VI: Prohibited Imports.\n\nTo recall, Annex III (Tariff Frameworks) provides the frameworks of the tariffs to be charged to all users of the Railway Facilities and the Mineral Terminal Facilities. Pursuant to article 18.17 of the Convention, these tariffs must potentially incorporate the Tariff Frameworks.\n\nThe Tax Depreciation Schedule contemplated in Annex V is not defined by the convention. We understand that for tax purposes, it shall provide the depreciation rates applicables to assets within the framework of the Project.\n\nFinally, according to article 36.4 (c) of the Convention, Annex VI sets the list of items that are prohibited for importation as of the Signature Date, it being specified that that listing may be amended from time to time. \n\n\n','Prepare a draft of Appendicees III (Tariff Frameworks, respectively Mineral Terminal Tariff Framework and Railway Tariff Framework), V (Tax Depreciation Schedule) and VI (Prohibited Imports) to be negotiated with the Government, as well as the agreement on the form of the Appendicees contemplated by article 4.1 (c) of the Convention.

However, the Road Plan does not feature in the Convention within the pages allocated to Annexes, where there are only 9 Annexes as provided in the general table of contents of the Convention. \n\nIn fact, the original wording of article 14.1 of the Convention shows that it was initially planned to include the Road Plan as an Annex to the Convention. We understand that this option has been abandonned as article 14.1 of the Convention does not provide anymore the inclusion of the Road Plan among the Annexes to the Convention. 9 Annexes should therefore be considered rather than 10.\n\nAmong theses Annexes, Annex I (Accession Notice), Annex II (BF Construction Conditions), Annex IV (Collective Bargaining Agreement), Annex VII (Fiscal & Custom Regime), Annex VIII (Mine Gate Value Determination) and Annex IX (Certain Shareholders Provisions) were attached to the Convention at the Signature Date.\n\nThis Conditions Precedent is, therefore, relating to 3 of the Annexes to the Convention:\n\n- Annex III: Tariff Frameworks;\n- Annex V: Tax Depreciation Schedule; and\n- Annex VI: Prohibited Imports.\n\nTo recall, Annex III (Tariff Frameworks) provides the frameworks of the tariffs to be charged to all users of the Railway Facilities and the Mineral Terminal Facilities. Pursuant to article 18.17 of the Convention, these tariffs must potentially incorporate the Tariff Frameworks.\n\nThe Tax Depreciation Schedule contemplated in Annex V is not defined by the convention. We understand that for tax purposes, it shall provide the depreciation rates applicables to assets within the framework of the Project.\n\nFinally, according to article 36.4 (c) of the Convention, Annex VI sets the list of items that are prohibited for importation as of the Signature Date, it being specified that that listing may be amended from time to time. \n\n\n','Prepare a draft of Appendicees III (Tariff Frameworks, respectively Mineral Terminal Tariff Framework and Railway Tariff Framework), V (Tax Depreciation Schedule) and VI (Prohibited Imports) to be negotiated with the Government, as well as the agreement on the form of the Appendicees contemplated by article 4.1 (c) of the Convention.
